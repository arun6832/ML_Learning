Linear Regression
Linear Regression typically has fewer hyperparameters compared to other models. Common hyperparameters include:

Fit Intercept: Whether to calculate the intercept for the model. If set to False, no intercept will be used in the calculation.

Normalize: This parameter specifies whether the input features should be normalized.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True)

2. SVM Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers have several important hyperparameters:

C: Regularization parameter. The strength of the regularization is inversely proportional to C. Must be strictly positive.
Kernel: Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm ('linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid', 'precomputed').
Gamma: Kernel coefficient for 'rbf', 'poly', and 'sigmoid'. If gamma is 'scale', it uses 1 / (n_features * X.var()) as value of gamma.
Degree: Degree of the polynomial kernel function ('poly'). Ignored by all other kernels.
Example:

from sklearn.svm import SVC
model = SVC(C=1.0, kernel='rbf', gamma='scale', degree=3)

3. K Means Clustering
K-Means clustering has several key hyperparameters:

n_clusters: The number of clusters to form and the number of centroids to generate.
init: Method for initialization ('k-means++', 'random', or an ndarray).
n_init: Number of times the k-means algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds.
max_iter: Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a single run.
tol: Relative tolerance with regards to inertia to declare convergence.
Example:

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
model = KMeans(n_clusters=8, init='k-means++', n_init=10, max_iter=300, tol=1e-4)

4. Neural Networks
Neural networks have numerous hyperparameters, including:

Learning Rate: Controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.
Number of Layers: The depth of the network (number of layers).
Number of Neurons per Layer: The width of the network (number of neurons in each layer).
Activation Functions: Functions applied to the neurons, like 'relu', 'sigmoid', 'tanh', etc.
Batch Size: The number of training examples utilized in one iteration.
Epochs: Number of complete passes through the training dataset.
Example:


from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
These examples demonstrate how to specify hyperparameters for different machine learning models using popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn and Keras. Adjusting these hyperparameters appropriately can significantly affect the performance of the models.
